They are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy. \n\nIronically, Vogon “Construction” Fleet destroyed the -Earth- several hundred years ago because they were commanded to build a bypass through the Earth. \n\nAnyway, being picked up by a Vogon Construction Fleet is actually not the ideal way of being picked up in the space since -Vogon- is mean and sometimes pretty unreasonable and ridiculous. \n\nOne of the fleet captain is -Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz-. \n\nThe fleet, according to rare video resources, consists of hundreds of ships which have the shape of a large rectangular blocks. \n\nEven though many people point out that this kind of design is for a concise and easy-going appearance, Vogons themselves consider the style as “easy to be remembered and counted when executing missions”.
