			<p>Space, is big.</p>
			<p>Really big.</p>
			<p>You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is.</p>
			<p>I mean you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space.</p>
			<P>Listen, actually, it is a grain of sand.</P>
			<P>From the very beginning of the space, some arrogant creatures even thought that the space is actually pretty small.</P>
			<p>And that was why they build up spaceships or anyway, machines in order to travel around the space.</p>
			<p>Through their races of "who can get to the end of the space first ", most of the creatures extincted since they all ran out of patience.</p>
			<p>Also, they didn’t realize that light has its speed and does transporting through the space until someone suggests to travel in the space by ridding on light.</p>
			<p>Anyway, being modest is the most important attitude you shall have when facing the space.</p>
			<p>By the way, the huge space supports a huge population.
			The Well-known planet Bethselamin once suffered from cumulative erosion by 10,000,000,000 visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your body weight when you leave the planet.</p>
			<p>(Please get a receipt after going to a lavatory.)</p>
			<p>Well, continue the hugeness topic. </p>
			<p>It takes eight minutes for light to travel from the star Sol to the place where the Earth used to be, and four years more to arrive at Sol’s nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima.</p>
			<p>However, it will take 500,000 years for light to reach the other side of the space, for instance, Damogran.
			Additionally, if you carelessly enter the space, with a lungful of air you can survive in the vacuum for about 30 seconds. </p>
			<P>Since the space is ridiculously huge, the chance to be saved or picked up is 
			1 / 2267791.</P>
			<p>As long as you get this e-book, please don't panic.</p>
			<p>Please be relaxed.</p>
